# a = -0.510066 b = 0.760666 c = -0.35663 d = -0.184483
# TODO Read the part of the article about the genetic algorithm
# TODO Create a fitness function

# TODO Create a genetic algorithm based on the

# List over vectors with boards attached:
# [(List over parameters, board), ...]

# TODO create init-method that creates agents with random vectors
# TODO create run_games-method that goes through the agents, and play 100 games each, return average lines cleared
# TODO create method for fetching a random 10%, and finds the two with highest lines cleared, and makes a child (with 5% chance of mutation)
# TODO create method that makes 30% new agents from existing agents (last method), replace worst 30% with the new agents
